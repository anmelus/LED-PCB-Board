## LED Board project

This project demonstrates the design and development of a custom LED board, starting from PCB creation using KiCAD to writing the software that powers it. Below, you'll find details on how the project is structured and how to get started.

### Overview

This project involves the complete design and implementation of a custom LED board. It includes:

1. The PCB Design created using KiCAD.
2. The software to control the LED board, providing functionality such as LED patterns, brightness control, and more.

This repository serves as a resource for hobbyists and developers who want to understand the process of creating hardware and writing corresponding software.

### Features

Features

* Custom PCB Design: Created using KiCAD for a fully custom LED board.
* Software Integration: Firmware/software to control LEDs with custom patterns and behavior.
* Modular Design: Easy to modify and expand upon.
